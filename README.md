# Development Setup

## Initial Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. **Add Text Data**: 
   - Place your `.txt` receipt data files in a **folder** within the cloned repository. 
   - For example you can place the `.txt` files in the data/txt_data folder 
3. **Add openai api key**
   - Include your OpenAI API key on line 10 of master.py

## Generating JSON Receipts from Text Files
To convert text receipt files to JSON format, follow these steps:

1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**:
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the cloned repository's directory.
2. **Run the Conversion Script**:
   - Execute the `master.py` script with the command:
     ```bash
     python master.py <path_to_receipt_txt_folder> <desired_path_of_output>
     ```
   - `path_to_receipt_txt_folder`: Path to your receipt text folder. This must be a folder containing the `.txt` files
   - `desired_path_of_output`: Path where you want to save the output JSON file. If the specified file exists, new data will be appended to it. This path must end with `.json`.

## Adding Classifications to JSON Receipts
To add classifications to your JSON receipts, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Classification Script**:
   - In the same directory, execute the `classification.py` script using the command:
     ```bash
     python classification.py <path_to_previous_output> <new_output_path>
     ```
   - `path_to_previous_output`: Path to the JSON file generated by `master.py`.
   - `new_output_path`: Path for the new JSON file which will include classifications. This file will be created at this path, must end with `.json`

## Workflow Example
Here's an example of the entire workflow:

1. Convert text receipts to JSON:
   ```bash
   python master.py data/txt_data json_receipts.json
   ```
2. Create new JSON file with classifications added:
   ```bash
   python classification.py json_receipts.json classified_json_receipts.json
   ```
